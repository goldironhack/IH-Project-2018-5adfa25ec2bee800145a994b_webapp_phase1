1. Find where to live;

2. Keywords: distance, safety, affordability.

3. Datasets:
- [NY Districts geoshapes] [http://services5.arcgis.com/GfwWNkhOj9bNBqoJ/arcgis/rest/services/nycd/FeatureServer/0/query?where=1=1&outFields=*&outSR=4326&f=geojson] [GEOJSON with coordinates of the shapes of the districts for draw the polygons in the map] 

- [No] Do you use the primary dataset ”online climate data” from data.gov?
- [Yes] Are all these datasets from data.gov or data.indy.gov? 

4. Brief Description
- The project consists of finding and classifying the houses near the NYU Stern School of Business using the API of Google Maps. The classification will be based on three parameters: security, proximity to the university and affordability.

- Map View:

  i. [The map is located in the NYU Stern School of Business, New York].
  
  ii. [No] Any cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect).

- Data Visualization:

  i. [No] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
  ii. [No] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)

- Interaction Form: 

  i.[No] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...).
  
  ii.[No] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...) 
  
  iii. [No] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
  
  iv. [No] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...) 
  
  v. [No] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)

6. Test Case: I tried my project on google chrome

7. Additional information: I had a problem with the map display what happened is that when compiling on the ironhacks platform I did not load the map. But in the text editor that I use (Visual Studio) it was normal. Contact Alejandro Diaz Vecchio by mail and he told me what was the possible error
